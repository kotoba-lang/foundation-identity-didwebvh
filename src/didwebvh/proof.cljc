  "The `eddsa-jcs-2022` Data Integrity proof, as did:webvh 1.0 constrains it.

   The cryptosuite itself is not implemented here -- `data-integrity.eddsa`
   already implements it algorithm for algorithm against W3C vc-di-eddsa, and
   a second copy is how one of them ends up quietly wrong. What this namespace
   owns is the method's extra conditions: the proof purpose is
   `assertionMethod`, the verification method is a `did:key`, and the key it
   names must appear VERBATIM in the active `updateKeys`.

   No key material passes through here. `create` takes a `sign-fn` of the
   64-byte-signature-from-hash shape, so an HSM or KMS signer substitutes
   without this library ever holding a seed -- which is the whole point of
   putting an organization's update key in one."

   `:allowed`, when given, is the set of multikeys authorized to make this
   proof -- the ACTIVE `updateKeys` for a log entry, or one witness's key for
   a witness proof. Omitting it verifies the signature and says nothing about
   authority, which is only ever useful in a test.

   `:verify-signature` replaces the Ed25519 check itself: `(fn [public-key
   hash-data signature] -> boolean)`, defaulting to the suite's own. Every
   check EXCEPT this one is pure arithmetic on the document, so substituting
   here -- a platform verifier, a memo table, a counter -- moves the only
   expensive part without touching the rules. It must return a boolean, not a
   Promise: `didwebvh.log/verify-async` is how an asynchronous verifier is
   driven, and it drives it by answering the questions first."
