  "`versionTime` as an integer, without a clock.

   The method makes two demands of time -- entries are strictly ordered, and
   an entry may not be dated more than a few minutes ahead of the reader --
   and both are comparisons. Neither needs to know what time it is now, so
   nothing here reads a clock: `now` arrives as an argument, which is what
   lets a resolver run inside `kotoba/pure`, and what lets a test pin the
   whole comparison.

   String comparison is not used, deliberately. `2025-01-23T04:12:36Z` and
   `2025-01-23T04:12:36.000Z` name the same instant and do not compare equal
   as text, so a log that alternates the two forms would look non-monotonic."
