  "Building one DID log entry, and the two documents an entry hashes into.

   They are two, and mixing them is the mistake this namespace exists to make
   hard:

   - `hash-input` -- the entry with `proof` removed and `versionId` set to the
     PREVIOUS versionId (the SCID, for the first entry). This is what the
     entry hash is taken over, which is what chains an entry to its
     predecessor.
   - `proof-input` -- the entry with `proof` removed and its OWN final
     versionId in place. This is what the Data Integrity proof signs, so the
     signature commits to the version number and the hash together.

   The spec's creation order is the reason: calculate the SCID, substitute it,
   calculate the entry hash, set `versionId` to `<n>-<entryHash>`, and only
   THEN sign. A proof taken over the pre-hash form would verify against an
   entry whose versionId nobody had committed to."
