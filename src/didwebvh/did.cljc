(ns didwebvh.did
  "The DID string and the two URLs it transforms into.

   `did:webvh:<scid>:<domain>[:<path-segment>…]`, where the domain may carry a
   port as `%3A<port>` and every further colon is a path separator. The
   transformation is the whole reason the method needs no registry: the DID
   says where its own log is.

       did:webvh:{SCID}:example.com
         -> https://example.com/.well-known/did.jsonl
       did:webvh:{SCID}:identity.example.com:orgs:acme
         -> https://identity.example.com/orgs/acme/did.jsonl
       did:webvh:{SCID}:example.com%3A3000:path
         -> https://example.com:3000/path/did.jsonl

   The witness file sits beside the log: `/did.jsonl` becomes
   `/did-witness.json`, including in the `.well-known` case.

   This namespace REFUSES rather than guesses. A non-ASCII domain is rejected
   with `:didwebvh/non-ascii-domain` instead of being punycoded here, because
   an IDNA2008 implementation that is approximately right maps two different
   names onto one URL, and the failure surfaces as somebody else's DID
   document. Callers hold the A-label."
