(ns didwebvh.log
  "Verify a whole DID log, which is what resolving a `did:webvh` DID is.

   Nothing here fetches. The log and the witness file arrive as parsed JSON
   values and `now` arrives as a number, so verification runs with no ambient
   authority at all -- the property that lets the same code run in a resolver,
   in a gate, and inside a guest that has no network.

   `verify` returns a map and never throws for a bad log: a log that fails is
   an answer. It returns `{:ok? false :error <keyword> :index n :version-id s}`
   naming the FIRST entry that failed, because a resolver that reports the last
   failure invites the reader to fix the wrong entry.

   What it checks, per entry, in this order: shape, versionId format and
   sequence, entry hash, versionTime, parameters (including pre-rotation),
   the entry proof against the ACTIVE updateKeys, the SCID (first entry),
   `state.id` and portability, and the witness threshold."

;; ── driving an asynchronous verifier ─────────────────────────────────────────
;;
;; `verify` is a loop that must decide each entry before it can know which keys
;; are authorized for the next one, so it cannot await anything. What it CAN do
;; is answer the same questions twice: once optimistically, to find out which
;; signatures matter, and once for real.
;;
;; The optimistic pass says `true` to every signature, which can only let the
;; loop travel FURTHER than the real answers would -- every check that consumes
;; a verdict either continues or stops, and `true` is the continuing side. So
;; the questions it asks are a superset of the questions the real pass asks,
;; and running the identical code path both times is what keeps the two from
;; drifting apart. The price is one extra pass of JCS canonicalization and
;; SHA-256, which is microseconds beside the Ed25519 it removes.
