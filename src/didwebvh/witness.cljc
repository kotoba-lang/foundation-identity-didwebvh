(ns didwebvh.witness
  "Witnesses and the threshold, which is the part of did:webvh that makes
   multi-party control a METHOD rule rather than an operational promise.

   `updateKeys` does not do this. Several keys may be listed and any ONE of
   them signs a valid entry -- the list is a set of equals, not a quorum. The
   witness parameter is where `m-of-n` lives, and a resolver that finds fewer
   than `threshold` weight of valid witness proofs must refuse the update.

       {\"threshold\" 3
        \"witnesses\" [{\"id\" \"did:key:zSecurity\"}
                     {\"id\" \"did:key:zLegal\"}
                     {\"id\" \"did:key:zOperations\"}
                     {\"id\" \"did:key:zAuditor\"}
                     {\"id\" \"did:key:zRecovery\"}]}

   `weight` defaults to 1, so the shape above is plain 3-of-5.

   What witnesses sign is the VERSION, not the entry: the spec says the proofs
   \"use the versionId as input data\", so the signed document is
   `{\"versionId\": \"<versionId>\"}`. The versionId already commits to the
   entry through its hash, so a witness approving a version approves exactly
   the bytes that hashed to it -- and a proof cannot be replayed onto another
   version, because the version is what was signed.

   The file is a JSON ARRAY of `{\"versionId\", \"proof\"}` objects published
   beside the log as `did-witness.json` (see `didwebvh.did/witness-url`)."
