(ns didwebvh.hash
  "The one hash `did:webvh` 1.0 uses, applied to three different inputs.

   The method names three hashes -- the SCID, the entry hash, and a
   pre-rotation key hash -- and they are the same function:

       base58btc(multihash(sha256(bytes)))

   What differs is only what goes in: JCS-canonical JSON of a log entry for
   the first two, the UTF-8 bytes of a multikey STRING for the third. Writing
   them as one `digest` with three named callers is the point: a reader who
   sees three hash implementations has to check three, and the spec has one.

   v1.0 admits SHA-256 only (multihash code 0x12). `sha256-multihash?` is
   here because verification is required to read the algorithm off the
   multihash prefix rather than assume it -- an implementation that assumes
   accepts a hash it never checked."
