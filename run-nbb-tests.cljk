(ns run-nbb-tests
  "The same conformance suite under ClojureScript, plus the async signing
   check.

   `.cljc` is a claim about two runtimes and the JVM suite only measures one.
   Both of the primitives this library leans on branch at the reader --
   `multiformats.core/sha256` and the Ed25519 arithmetic are different code
   paths here -- so the digests, the base58btc round trip and every
   signature are re-measured.

   The async check (`didwebvh.async-test/run`) is Promise-based rather than a
   `deftest`: cljs.test's `async` needs report plumbing this harness does not
   carry, and a run containing one returns nil -- the shape of \"nothing ran\".

   THE EXIT CODE DOES NOT COME FROM THE RETURN VALUE OF `run-tests`. Under
   nbb that value is nil (measured 2026-09-07), so destructuring `:fail`
   /`:error`/`:test` from it yields nil for every key, `(zero? nil)` is
   false, and `(+ nil nil n)` is `n` -- a suite that fails (or runs nothing)
   exits 0 with the failures still on the screen. The exit code comes instead
   from the `:end-run-tests` report hook, which cljs.test DOES dispatch with
   the real summary as the map (measured 2026-09-07: the event is
   `{:test N :pass N :fail N :error N :type :end-run-tests}`).

   Exits 2 when nothing ran. A harness that reports success for zero tests is
   the failure this file exists to avoid: it looks exactly like a pass."
